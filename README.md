# Hiking from Zurich

This repo is to write down my experiences of hiking from easy to difficult. Because this experiences are for beginner, most of the hiking route are one-day-hiking from Zurich. If you live in other Canton, this beginner guide may not suit you.

## Equipment

I'm not an expert on hiking equipment. But I was always been told a pair of good hiking shoes is the most important thing you need to buy. The hiking shoes should have a `GTX` water-proof surface and a `Vibram` bottom. And it is also recommended to buy shoes in an outdoor store because they will give you professional advice.

A pair of trekking poles can help you save a lot of stength on up-hill and down-hill. You don't have to buy a very expensive one, just find trekking poles which are convient to carry.s

## How to find a hiking route

[Switzerland Mobility](https://www.schweizmobil.ch/en/summer.html) is an excellent website for finding a hiking route. The hiking network on the website is very complete and well classified. The yellow line means obstacle free route and the red one means mountaineering.

Uetliberg is the most easily reachable mountain from Zurich. It is very easy and doesn't require any skill and equipment.
